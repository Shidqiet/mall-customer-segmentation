# Mall Customer Analysis and Segmentation Using K-Means Algorithm

Hello everyone!

In this data science project, I am gonna try to analyze and cluster mall customer from Mall Customer Segmentation dataset (https://www.kaggle.com/vjchoudhary7/customer-segmentation-tutorial-in-python). 

Data Information:

* 200 rows
* 5 columns

Description:
* CustomerID: Customer ID
* Gender: Whether the customer is a male or a female (Male, Female)
* Age: Customer's age
* Annual Income (k$): Annual Income of the customee (in thousand dollars)
* Spending Score (1-100): Score assigned by the mall based on customer behavior and spending nature

To extract actionable insights from the dataset. I listed all the questions that came to mind below after assessing the dataset, and I tried to investigate all of them to find the insights:

1. How is the distribution of each feature in the dataset?
2. How is the correlation between features in the dataset? 
3. Can we cluster the customer using k-means algorithm?

In order to know the answer please check the notebook!
